what are you targets next year?  i understand the frustration this causes, andy ^cb  always some supposedly acceptable reason, yes i get that, but when one uses the trains every week and spends a lot of money, for it to be late regularly is just not acceptable.  sadly the service has been delayed due to a fault on the line ^cb  the 06:20 from euston. now i\\'m here waiting on the 19:00 from b\\'ham int. also late.  hi andy, really sorry to hear this. which service are you travelling on please?

you can set buyer requirements which will block buyers who have strikes against them which will reduce this from happening. see here&gt;  thanks ^sg everytime i sell something on   the bid comes back as fraudulent and i have to repost.  7 days wasted.  i’m done.  ugh.  hi there. sorry to hear the item has not arrived. is there tracking for the item? if not, i\\'d advise opening an item not received claim. you can learn more about that here&gt;  any other questions, let us know. ^sg  the item has been marked as delivered, and the system would not let me contact ebay customer service directly. it was not sellers fault, it was mismanaged somewhere between shipment and delivery. still file a claim?  need to contact customer service directly. please dm contact email for customer service  as the seller is responsible for the courier, they can claim for lost items from the courier. you still have to open a claim through ebay to be protected. please follow the previous steps. we cant outbound dm. you can dm us if you have any other questions. ^sg  ok, thank you for your help, i\\'ll do that.  you\\'re more than welcome. any other questions, please dont hesitate to ask. thanks ^sg  i have further questions about my ebay transaction- i dm\\'ed to explain, thanks  just responded a moment ago - thanks for your patience! ^tl  thanks!!  need further assistance about situation- i dmed the recap and update. thanks in advance!  need assistance. bought item, due to be delivered saturday. never received item, despite being marked as delivered. no response from seller, delivery services cannot assist with lost/missing package. please advise.  oh no! any aspect about navigation that you find difficult?

 hi, i definitely understand your concern. i\\'m showing a good signal from here, are you checking the connection wired or wireless?  -dee  both. 18 down and 17 up, wired. and 8 down and 7 up wireless  hi, at this moment i am not showing any reported issues in your area.  i pinged your modem several times and i\\'m not showing any packet loss. is it alright if i send a refresh to your equipment? if so, please let me know when it will be a good time send the signal.  -mary  you may  i\\'ve sent the refresh to your wifi modem.  it may take up to 10 minutes for it to reload.  please run a speed test on the hardwired connection once you\\'re back online and share your results.  -mary  and here is my speed hardwired. i realize you guys say speeds up to a certain amount but if i’m paying for that amount, i shouldn’t be getting 8 or 9 download. this is outrageous. i pay for up to 100 i believe. why can’t i even get half of that?!   hi, while hardwired to your equipment, are you able to sign into your account online at  and perform a speed test so that we can analyze it from here? -renee  i’m trying to do it via what i have set up but i don’t have a computer. i might be able to. hang tight  sure thing, let us know the results.  -latitia  so, as you can see something is clearly up. i actually found out i’m paying for up to 300mbps download and i’ve not even hit over 100 yet.   one that is at least one that is a cat5e or cat6. anything less would not be able to go faster than 100. - brian   any reason why i’m not even hitting 100? what do i have to do to get this resolved? i’m obviously not even getting a third of what i pay for.  do you have a wired device with a gigabit ethernet port you can try connecting to the modem and testing with? -chris  unfortunately, i only have the ethernet cable i was provided through cox.  i was referring to your devices and not the cord.  you should be able to use the same cord for this test. -chris  i’ve run the test across multiple platforms. i have a technician coming out to resolve the issue as the packet loss is incredibly high  do you have any trace routes showing the packet loss? -chris  the associate i spoke with does  i was not able to find that information in the previous conversation.  would you be able to provide the trace routes in a dm?  i am not seeing any signal issues to the modem. ~derrick  there’s definitely an issue. i’ve run multiple tests across cox, speed test, and ookla. i’m getting around 11-18 download. as for the trace routes, the associate i spoke with on the phone may be able to provide that. but i’m not getting anywhere near 300 down  hi there, i am glad that you scheduled a technician to further investigate your issue.  it is difficult to diagnose your issue remotely.  please let us know the results after the technician visits.   -latitia  thank you. will post results  i just checked your modem and it looks like the device that is plugged into the modem currently is only capable of up to 100 mbps. this could be the ethernet cord or the network card inside of the computer. do you have another ethernet cord to test with? preferably (1)  this is the ethernet cord i was given with the modem. unfortunately that’s the only one i have. even at 100mbps that’s 1/3 of what i could potentially get via my plan but i’m only seeing 11...  here’s wifi even though i have the th panoramic. not at all close to what i’m paying for. running the wired one now   i continually give you guys the benefit of the doubt, but i’m paying for (yes i know, up to 100mbps down) and i’m getting 8! i need this fixed. like yesterday.  thank you for following up. a member of our team will be in touch shortly through dm.  i dm\\'ed you!  it seems a member of our team has reached out to you. please check your email and follow up with them there.  i need help with my account, it gets disabled every time i try to login and it\\'s getting really frustrating!😬😠  we have received your dm and will follow up there.   you haven’t “reached out”. please refund the cost of the inedible food without delay  we\\'ve folllwed up via dm.  just did  we\\'re here to help! send us a dm with your email address so we can connect. hi   this is an inadequate response to me telling you i had to throw away the entire £18 order. if eat in, would’ve been sent back   here to help! send us a note at  so our team can connect.  i ordered food through uber eats. i did not get the delivery. please contact me.  we take this very seriously. please send us a dm with your email address so we can connect asap. hey, all, this guy picked my cousin up in pittsburgh on friday for  and tried sexually assaulting her. his name is feruzbek.   here to help! follow up here;  and our team will connect right away.   my  app doesn\\'t work ever, it won\\'t let me order food. keeps saying i need to confirm my phone number 🤦🏽\\u200d♂️ ///  we\\'re here to help! send us a dm with your email address and specific details of your issue so we can follow up. . how do i dispute a charge?

it\\'s the same store. misleading and incompetent.  hi stephen, i have contacted the store and they have informed me that it is due to the 6 pack currently being half price. thanks - mark  it was 4 loose pies in poly bag with a  label.. local staff said different ingredients was the reason!  hi stephen, this is because the 6 pack of pies are currently half price at the moment whereas the 4 pack are not. hope this helps. - kirsten  haddington: 6 x mini melton mowbray pies @ £1.00; 4 x mini melton mowbray pies on reduced shelf @ £1.04! #tescon  hi stephen, it could be that my colleague were unaware of the deal on the 6 pack when reducing the 4 to clear. 1/2  one of the reasons i usually shop elsewhere is complicated special offers &amp; then being told at checkout how much money i have saved.  then manager said they had different ingredients! exact same description, different ingredients...i doubt that is legal.  hi stephen, please be assured your feedback has been passed to the management team at our haddington superstore. ty - joanne  this annoyed me because i already had the 6 pack. saw reduced to clear offer, put 6 pack back on shelf &amp; found it was cheaper than 4 pack!  to avoid misleading public standard procedure should be to ensure goods on clearance shelf are cheaper than same goods elsewhere in shop.  that\\'s ok kevin. if there is anything else i can help you with, please don\\'t hesitate to contact me back. ty - jayne  im just gonna pop back to the store when passing. it will be much easier. i dont have the receipt details but i think they were a quid.  also the supplier code(sc), would it be ok to pass your details to our supplier?

2/4  hi kate, just before i call the store can you please let me know if you spoke with anyone in store about this? thanks - mark  i spoke to a check-out guy who said he worked in stock and he said something about freezers being broken. but that’s not good enough.  we are just waiting on a delivery to restock the freezer and this will be resolved for you. lawrence 2/2  hi kate, really sorry about the inconvenience cause by this, i spoke to store and they have told me they had a fault with the freezer. 1/2  i also then drove to tesco prestwich and they only had 2 packets of quorn mince left.  please can let me know the date/time you visited the store. ty - jayne 2/2  came specifically to buy some quran mince and was met by this in cheetham hill. not impressed!   also, can you include the sc code (sc12345) and the store you purchased these from?

#giveusthedeets  yes i see that. your app says the incoming flight arrives at 10:05 so how are we going to take off at 10:10?   looks like it has a maintenance delay and it\\'s currently scheduled to take off at 10:10p.  what’s going on with flight 301 dtw &gt; dfw? delayed over 3 hours. will it be canceled?  our crew is there to serve you and not deceive you in any way. we\\'re also here to help so please share your flight details via dms.  1st and foremost - your crew has been lying to us for over an hour. then after being deceived by your crew for over an hour - we are being lied to again as they advised us the new plane we are transferring to is departing at 7:45pm - however they have not begun boarding yet.  not only has my family, and several other families been inconvenienced by   today - this is now 16 flights in one year with only 5 \"on time\" departures.  our offer still stands to assist, andrew.  but - that\\'s really not the issue. the issue is  habitually inconveniences its customer base and displays a demeanor that its a  normal practice in the airlines industry with no above and beyond accommodations offered to its inconvenienced and unsatisfied customers !  i have flown  15 times in the past 12 months and only departed on schedule 4 times.  after 1 hour of being lied to by the pilot - we are now being totally inconvenienced by having to un-board this plane and board another plane - meanwhile i should be landing in miami in 50 minutes. completely irresponsible and utmost negligent on pilots behalf  we\\'re sorry for the delay. the previous pilot may not have been aware of the problem. we appreciate your patience.  stuck on flight 609 in charlotte over 55 minutes due to a computer card tech issue while pilot repeatedly advised it would only take a \"few minutes\" to fix. why wasn\\'t this issue reported by previous pilot that arrived minutes b4 we boarded in effort to save time?  please dm your record locator, we\\'d like to forward this feedback.  i was forced to check my small suitcase. never happened before.  there was plenty of storage space too. fml  we\\'re sorry for the extended travel time today, ally. our team is working hard to reunite you with your bags. give me and the 50,000 other people our bags  #travelwoes #longestday  we\\'re going to forward this to our flight service leadership team for appropriate review.  so i assume nothing is coming from tho incident. it has been several days since we made a complaint at the desk in person after the flight and this tweet. pretty much you blew off any concernnto a act of battery on the plane against a child. this is ridiculous!!!  shame on you and your company  i just got off one of your flights aa1792 from portland. the gentlemen in front of my 3 year old son, decided to rip at his feet for pressing them against his seat. when i confronted the coward verbally your stewardesses did absolutely nothing...  we see you\\'re arriving just a few minutes early, we\\'re always working to get you to your destination as soon as possible. the audacity of  1416 landing early tonight. i might have to negotiate a shared ride cause there’s no taxis. #talesfromthetaxi  hi, matt, we\\'ve your info but we\\'d like to verify which trip you\\'d like to cancel. please dm your record locator with the unwanted return.  i had to end my trip way sooner than expected. :( bought a new flight because it was way cheaper than changing my return. what do i need to do to cancel my return so someone can have that seat?  thanks for your loyalty! it means the world to us. thank you  for being responsive and helpful and more than making up for a bad flight!  #stayingloyal   you wouldn\\'t get those perks on ba, martin.  if i have the platinum select aadvantage card and i purchased an int’l ticket through your site but it ended up being on british air, will i still retain the same benefits of my aadvantage card on this flight (i.e, early boarding)?  our sincere apologies for any last minute gate changes, we know that\\'s not fun. please let us know if we can help here.  my post has nothing to do with a gate change, merely a lack of oversight and organisation on the part of  and it’s employees. perhaps you should read and comprehend your customer’s posts before responding.  let’s see if your social media team will respond here, as they obviously overlook negative feedback on facebook. #americanairlines #noresponse   we apologize for the inconvenience. travelers submit their paperwork to us, but aren\\'t required to show it to everyone on board.  exactly as seen on our flight.  #getsomerealpoliciesandenforcethem   we expect all of our flyers to be courteous to each other and sadly this gentleman wasn\\'t today.  she sure is a gorgeous bird!  thanks for awesome flight home #dreamliner   thanks for joining us on board!  omg seriously.. all   the..   feels   #alllllthefeelz  see what they did there  awww #aws #reinvent stating off right, standby early on  and a super80! missed you buddy #allthefeelz   we\\'re sorry for the extra travel time today, rocky. please dm us your record locator and well take a look. hey  rocky here on flight aa2254. we were supposed to depart at 6:07pm but it is now 6:54pm and the crew just informed us that our captain is missing. oh and not to mention we also had a maintenance issue. hope to make it to nyc safe and sound. #disappointed  any dogs you see outside of a kennel are either service or emotional support animals.  my wide was told to move her small handbag from the floor of the bulkhead row while this 40lb dog sprawled in the aisle.  wife, not wide.  no markings.  no paperwork.  in the bulkhead.  no policies,   you’re missing my point.  numerous people tripped over the dog, not to mention anyone who might have been allergic.  when did you change your policy to allow any size dog into cabins for any/no reason?  we\\'re sorry for the inconvenience, nick. did you ask a crew member if you could move to another seat?  i love dogs but they don’t belong in #airplane #cabins.  it was bad enough when anyone could say they had a #therapypet.  i can’t keep my small bag in the #bulkhead row but the woman next to me can have her 40lb dog?

  i  see some ba numbers are non-geographical local rate - local price for landlines but mobile operators charge the earth    were you calling the 0344 number or the 0844 number?    0844...    if this was an after-sales enquiry, consumer law gives you the right to a refund of the call charges.    consumer protection regulations have banned the use of 084, 087 &amp; 09 numbers for after-sales issues.    ba has changed to 0344 numbers but has left the old 0844 numbers running - and with same ivr options.    the premium rate 0844 numbers fail to tell callers that they can re-dial 0344 for a cheaper call.    never ring these from mobile they are way over priced by mbl companys  we’re sorry you feel this way stephanie, but you would need to contact your provider. call charges are clear on  ^pip  so how can i dispute this, please?

^rm  thanks rm. blurays play fine. these dvds also play fine on original xb1 and other devices. the discs aren’t dirty. here’s a video. my guess is the xb1x isn’t handling some form of macrovision correctly.   thank you for that, that is odd. here is another guide that may provide some support with the issue you are seeing.  ^rm  i will try, but to be clear, it is _only_ the bluray app doing this. games and other activities on the xb1x are fine. i\\'ve also noticed the audio is out of sync with the picture when using the bluray app - again, only this app - not forza or anything else.  were you able to work through the steps we sent? did they help with what you are seeing?  ^bl  i did. no, they did not. i also deleted and reinstalled the app. i don’t believe it is a tv or video output issue in general as all the games are fine. it is only the bluray player app which does this. i think the app is not handling macrovision or something.  a photo of your 4k stats on the console and your video settings including color space?  2 ^jl  though the ps4pro is not - for the same reason as with xb1x, it is connected to the tv for 4k output ...  thanks for that info. let\\'s change the color space to pc rgb and then change tv resolution to automatic or 1080p if that is possible.  ^jl  hi jl, why thank you! i am not given an \\'automatic\\' resolution option, unfortunately, but i set it to pc rgb and it works! the dvds play back fine now, even with resolution still on 4k. thank you kindly! what a champ. what is \\'colour space\\' out of interest?  this is an article explaining color space.  ^rm  terrific, thank you !  to be sure, are you using a receiver with the tv and console? can you send us  1 ^jl  hello, on my new xb1x many dvds play horribly - audio and video goes on and off, unwatchable. yet all else works fine, and the dvds played fine on original xb1 + also ps4pro. any ideas?

 we can let our team know you\\'d like to see it minimized. due to the nature of streaming, there is a slight delay from cable.  of course i want it minimized. it’s five minutes behind.  don’t call it live if twitter can spoil the result, you know?  typically, the delay is less than that. does this improve after working through:  is it hardwired?  it’s not my setup. hulu just chugs at the most random moments.   your speeds look great, so let us know the device in use. for now, try rebooting your device &amp; modem/router for 1-2 mins.  no, sorry, i’m not doing that. the world series is on. your app just keeps unilaterally stopping the stream. the issue is not my modem.  we definitely understand. if you\\'re open to it, please try rebooting after the game. for now, we\\'ll share your feedback. pretty neat how  ‘live’ stream of the ballgame is two batters behind twitter. 😑  since dvr content is recorded from the live feed, there will be ads present ( how long is the recording?  on live tv dvr, ~63 minutes. at hulu online 85 via browser w/ no ads. this is first week with dvr ads and they are no-skip ads.  gotcha! we\\'d like to gather a few additional details regarding this. when you have a chance, reach out:   will provide info. btw entire show is present this am and commercials are gone.  2/2) the ads will be removed. we hope this helps explain and look forward to your call/chat.  1/2) sounds good, den! with the no commercials add-on, once a show is added to our on-demand library (for dwts, the day after air)  livetv only had half of danc w/ stars recorded and had commercials which shouldn’t. what’s up?

 i didn\\'t add it but want to find out who did.  sorry to hear about trouble, bob! no issues to report on our end but we\\'re here to help. what device? try:   are you kidding me? the live stream of the series is down again?

 thanks for your patience. the permission was required for crash reporting purposes. this will be removed in the next app update.  the o2 priority app again wants new permissions with no explanation. this time it\\'s run at startup and draw over other apps. please explain.  🤔 we\\'re not sure what you mean jack. please dm us screenshots of what you\\'re seeing.   for some reason the add photo button wasn\\'t working in the dm, so i\\'ll send it here.   when the priority app is updated permissions change, you can turn them off in settings &gt; applications &gt; priority app. #o2guru  neither of those permissions can be disabled. also, \\'permissions change when updated\\' doesn\\'t explain why the permissions are needed.  for full and optimum use of the app these permissions are recommended. if you\\'re unhappy you can disable them as above 😃#o2guru  but why? they weren\\'t before. also, no, those particular permissions can not be disabled.  so just to clarify what phone were you using before this one? #o2guru  i see this on both my oneplus 2 and my lg nexus 5. both are running android 6.0.1. though android permissions aren\\'t device specific.  if the permissions cannot be disabled, they must be required to run the priority app as efficiently as possible #o2guru  again though, why? they weren\\'t in the previous version and there\\'s nothing in the what\\'s new section that correlates to the new permissions  can you please follow us jack, so we can send you some info? #o2guru  ok, following.  thanks jack 👍 we\\'ve sent you a dm now #o2guru  it shouldn\\'t take over a week to give a justification for an app permission. that information should be in the app description.  no update right now jack but we\\'ll be back in touch as quickly as we can.  any progress on this?  great thanks.  this is on my lg nexus 5 running android 6.0.1. my oneplus 2 says the same thing. the app version is 2.12.0 as shown in the screenshot.  hi jack, can you send us across the handset make and model you\\'re using and the software version you\\'re running please?
